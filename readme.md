	+ Breakpoints @ 480px, 767px, 1024px, 1174px, 1400px 
+ **Shortcodes**
	+ `shortcodes.php` - empty template ready for custom theme shortcodes to be added.
	+ All theme specific shortcodes can be placed here
+ **Sidebars**
	+ `sidebars.php`
	+ Any sidebars that need to be registered for this theme can be done here
+ **Theme Support**
	+ `theme-support.php`
	+ Any theme support options, such as registering new image sizes can be done here per theme

#### Modules
*Modules are developed individually for any custom post type use. These function a lot like plugins but from the theme level (keep this in mind when scoping vars)*

+ **Insert custom modules here** (seperate repositories available from [my profile](http://github.com/Xtremefaith))
	+ Use the custom module template to make you're own to reuse like a plugin built into your theme

####Tips
+ As with the Starter theme, the `functions.php` represent the control panel for the theme, so when investigating something it is the place to start
